## Bad Driving and Government Transparency

http://www.nola.gov/nopd/crime-data/911-calls-for-service/

"As part of its commitment to transparency, accountability, collaboration and integrity, NOPD has the last three years of 9-1-1 records available to the public from the Orleans Parish Communication District (OPCD) external link, the administrative office of 911 for the City of New Orleans."


Yes, it list data from 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, known around here as the "last three years"


Wanting to keep the data small enough to fit in the free tier of shiny.io, I
chose to focus on (98,DRIVING WHILE UNDER INFLUENCE) & (99,WRECKLESS DRIVING) 
for the last year, 2014
